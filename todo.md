[x] Design a simple db
[ ] Convert the loading/creation of the database into a golang function
[ ] CREATE OR ALTER TABLE probably would be useful.
[ ] (maybe) create an admin screen to practice sending a view
[ ] Then, create another module called models
[ ] In models, compose go structs around objects queried from the database
[ ] consider how to map models to api endpoints
